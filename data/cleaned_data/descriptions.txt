To my knowledge there is no one adding anything to the C drive on the application server. Can we get more space or can you look at it and see if anything can be deleted to clean it up?

[EU] how to uplaod a folder on onedrive
"Hi,
As suggested by Henry Sandoval I'm openning the incident, since I'm still struggling with getting needed access to portal.azure.com for the people from vendor side.

•	Users affected: ruhkopf.p (Ruhkopf Patrick), gocke.m (Gocke Marcel)
•	Group Genie: ECTG-eContentAzureGroup
•	Resources groups /VMS: AZ-RG-eContent-NonProd
•	Messages error: ""Invalid credentials"" when trying to login via PING site
•	How the users are logging (PG credentials): yes, P&G credentials

They have already intranet access granted, ping ID configured but still they cannot access portal.azure.com and cannot login with P&G credentials. They got error ""invalid credentials"", while they are able to login to the other P&G portals. I talked with itsolutions support twice and without luck - according to them, the users have sufficient roles and entitelments in itaccess.

After investigation I found that the users are visible as members of the group in GroupGenie but they are not members of the group in Azure Portal (see attached screeshots)

Please help to finally solve the issue."
